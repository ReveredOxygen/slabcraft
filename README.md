This modpack aims to bundle most of the mods that I expect most players would want on Slabserver. It uses [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) as a base for performance and Optifine features, and includes additional features on top. Importantly, every mod is configured in a way that follows Slab's rules. If a feature is illegal on Slab, its keybind will be set to `SCROLL_LOCK`. Do not rebind or enable these features without asking the admins for permission.  
Please read [Slab's modding rules](https://github.com/Slabserver/Slabserver-Documentation/wiki/Client-Mods) before using this pack, as some mods have restrictions that the player is expected to follow. If you're only using visual or map-related features, this is not relevant to you. If a feature in the list below has **[RESTRICTED]** next to it, make sure to read the rules before using it, as there are restrictions on how you're allowed to use it on Slab.

# Installing

I recommend using [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) to manage your mods. To install the pack in Prism, the steps are as follows:  

- Install and open Prism  
- Click "Add Instance" in the top left corner  
- Click "Modrinth" in the left sidebar  
- Type "Slabcraft" into the search bar  
- Click on the search result for Slabcraft  
- Click OK  
- The pack will install. When you return to the main menu, you can double click the new icon in order to open it.  

## Updating

To update under Prism, the steps are as follows:

- Select the pack (single click; don't launch it)
- Click "Edit" in the right sidebar.
- Click "Modrinth" in the left sidebar.
- Click "Update pack"

# Features

- **Map**: [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) is included, but disabled by default, as some players may not want it. To enable it, press `]`, click "Minimap Settings", then toggle "Minimap" to ON. To open the world map, press J. The default for Xaero's is M, but it is different in this pack because M conflicts with Litmatica. You can press N to create a waypoint.  
  - [AutoServerWorldSelection](https://github.com/TheMrEngMan/AutoServerWorldSelection) is included to make Xaero's play nicely with the Resource World.
- **[Minihud](https://modrinth.com/mod/minihud) is included and enabled by default. If you don't like the hud, press H to disable it. masa is taking a break from modding, so this pack includes [Sakura Ryoko's fork](https://github.com/sakura-ryoko/minihud).
  - **Light Overlay**: Minihud includes a light level overlay. Press F7 to toggle it.
- **Shulkers**: [Shulker Box Tooltip](https://modrinth.com/mod/shulkerboxtooltip) and [Simple Shulker Preview](https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-shulker-preview) are included to let you see inside shulkers without having to place them. Search "Shulker" in the mod menu to disable either mod.  
- **Better Grass** is included through [FabricBetterGrass](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabricbettergrass), but is disabled by default, as some players may not want it. To enable it, open the mod menu, search FabricBetterGrass, click the mod's icon, and change Better Grass Mode to Fancy. Then return to your world and press F3+A to refresh.  
- **Zoom** is included through [Ok Zoomer](https://modrinth.com/mod/ok-zoomer). By default, you can press C to zoom in, and scroll to adjust your zoom level. The mod is highly configurable, so be sure to read its description if you're interested.  
- **Fullbright** is included through [Tweakeroo](https://modrinth.com/mod/tweakeroo). You can press F6 to toggle it. masa is taking a break from modding, so this pack includes [Sakura Ryoko's fork](https://github.com/sakura-ryoko/tweakeroo).
- **[Bobby](https://modrinth.com/mod/bobby)** is included. It stores chunks on your computer in order to fake having a higher render distance than the server allows. I expect this to be very nice to have at the beginning of S4, as the server render distance will probably be lowered significantly to improve performance. To use it, simply increase your render distance to whatever value you want, and Bobby will make it happen. Note that chunks will not be visible until you've had them inside the server render distance, and they won't be visible while outside of it.
- **Custom Title Screen**: The title is changed to Minecraft: Slab Edition and I plan to change the panorama to spawn. To disable this, simply disable the Slabcraft.zip resource pack.
- **[RESTRICTED] Inventory**: [Inventory Profiles Next](https://modrinth.com/mod/inventory-profiles-next) is included. Make sure to read the modding rules before using this mod, as there are restrictions related to it. It has many features related to inventory management; there is a tutorial video on its page if you're interested. For example, you can middle click an inventory to sort it. Note that its villager trading features are currently not allowed on Slab.  
- **[RESTRICTED] [Freecam](https://github.com/MinecraftFreecam/Freecam)** is included. Make sure to read the modding rules before using this mod, as there are restrictions related to it. You can press F4 to toggle freecam mode.
- **[RESTRICTED] [Litematica](https://modrinth.com/mod/litematica)** is included. Easyplace is not allowed. masa is taking a break from modding, so this pack includes [Sakura Ryoko's fork](https://github.com/sakura-ryoko/litematica)
  - **Hardplace**: Hardplace is included through [TweakerMore](https://modrinth.com/mod/tweakermore). Press V to toggle it. Hardplace causes your game to automatically place the right block when working on a schematic. It is allowed on Slab, unlike Easyplace.
